## 🚀 Setup

### 1. Add this Action to your repo

Create a workflow file at `.github/workflows/ai-mobile-pr-review.yml`:

```yaml
name: AI Mobile PR Review

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review]

jobs:
  review:
    uses: Ahabdelhak/ai-mobile-pr-reviewer/.github/workflows/mobile-pr-review.yml@main
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    secrets:
      OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
      SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
    with:
      model_name: gpt-4o-mini
      max_files: 25
      max_patch_chars: 12000
      file_globs: "*.kt,*.kts,*.java,*.xml,*.swift,*.m,*.mm,*.gradle,*.gradle.kts,*.pro,*.plist,*.md"
```

### 2. Add your OpenAI API key

 * Go to your repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
 * Add a new secret:
    - Name: "OPENAI_API_KEY"
    - Value: "your OpenAI API key"

### 3. Open a Pull Request

The Action will run automatically and leave an AI-generated review comment on the PR.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Detects PR event via GitHub Actions
2. Filters relevant files (Kotlin, Swift, Gradle, XML, plist, etc.)
3. Summarizes diffs and trims noisy/binary files
4. Loads rubric from the central repo
5. Builds a context prompt and queries OpenAI model
6. Posts a structured review back as a PR comment

## 📝 TO DO (Roadmap)

Planned improvements for upcoming releases:

- [X] Slack integration (notify teams of high-risk PRs)
- [X] Cost optimization (batching diffs, token limits, caching)
- [X] Multi-language support (React Native, C++ for mobile)
- [X] Configurable rubric per repo (override central rubric with local rules)
- [ ] Inline review comments (comment directly on code lines, not just summary)
- [X] Custom model selection (support for GPT-4.1, Anthropic, open-source LLMs)
- [X] Rich reporting (summary + checklist in Markdown tables)
